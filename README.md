# Neural network-based weighing system
Neural network-based payload determination for moving excavator is a laboratory project based on research on the mini excavator
in the laboratory of the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology (PL). 
Project is in the initial phase, requires further improvements based on a larger number of measurements.

This project contains LSTM models created on personally collected dataset (156 measurement sessions), based on sensors connected to mini-excavator.
The regression model predicts weight in the bucket excavator. 
Measurements refers to pressure in the boom cylinder (upper and lower), actuators displacement and hydraulic oil temperature. 

**Measurement stand and test facility:**

###### Generally there are 6 features: 
  - upper (p1) and lower(p2) pressure in the boom cylinder
  - displacement the boom actuator (x1)
  - displacement the excavator arm (x2)
  - displacement the tool excavator (x3)
  - oil temperature (T)

###### Project contains following files:
1. `lstm_main_data_test` - model trained on basic dataset (without data augmentation or feature selection)
2. `lstm_augmentation_test` - model trained on augmented dataset
3. `lstm_GridSearchCV` - performed GridSearch test
4. `project_utils` - python file contains useful methods: 
  * format_data - function formatting 'original' data in performed dataset
  * prepare_data - reshapes data and make standardization. It returns feature 3D numpy array X and 2D labels array Y
  * augmentation - augments data - There are two methods: 
      1) first, based on scientific work: Ch. Bergmeir, R.J. Hyndman, J. M. Benitez *"Bagging Exponential Smoothing Methods using STL  Decomposition and Box-Cox Transformation"* and assumes use these 3 tools (MBB bootstrap, seasonal decomposition and Yeo-Johnson Transformation) on single timeseries.
      2) second method it's a simple technique: I generate a new sequence based on the noise (from normal distribution) of the original sequence. Standard deviation has been determined separately for each measurement. 

###### Results: Example of mass predictions on the basic (not augmented) dataset
